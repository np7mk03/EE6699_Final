# Neural Network Properties: The Effect of Network Width on Approximation Methods and Generalization

## Abstract
This research investigates how network width affects the performance and convergence properties of neural networks when using different approximation methods. By comparing standard ResNet and Wide ResNet (WRN) architectures with diagonal (diag), kernel, and Kronecker (kron) approximation methods, we aim to understand the relationship between model width, approximation quality, and generalization capabilities. Our analysis focuses on the Neural Tangent Kernel (NTK) regime and how network width influences the optimization landscape and generalization bounds. The findings contribute to our understanding of wide-network scaling laws and provide practical insights for selecting appropriate network architectures and approximation methods.

## Introduction
Neural networks with increasing width have been shown to exhibit interesting theoretical properties, particularly in the context of the Neural Tangent Kernel (NTK) regime. As networks become wider, their behavior during training becomes more predictable and can be described by kernel methods. This research aims to investigate:

1. How does network width affect the performance of different approximation methods (diagonal, kernel, and Kronecker)?
2. What is the relationship between network width and generalization capabilities within the NTK regime?

These questions are crucial for understanding the theoretical properties of neural networks and have practical implications for model selection and training optimization.

## Theoretical Background / Related Work

### Neural Tangent Kernel (NTK)
The Neural Tangent Kernel (NTK) provides a theoretical framework for understanding the dynamics of neural networks during training. As network width approaches infinity, the NTK converges to a deterministic kernel that remains constant during training. This makes the training dynamics of infinitely wide networks equivalent to kernel regression using the NTK.

### Approximation Methods
- **Diagonal (Diag)**: Approximates the Fisher information matrix using only diagonal elements, ignoring correlations between parameters.
- **Kernel**: Uses kernel methods to approximate the function space of the neural network.
- **Kronecker (Kron)**: Approximates the Fisher information matrix using Kronecker products, capturing more correlation structure than diagonal approximation.

### Wide Networks and Generalization
Wide networks have been theoretically shown to have better generalization properties due to their smoother loss landscapes and their behavior being well-approximated by the NTK. However, empirical validation of these theoretical results across different approximation methods remains an active area of research.

## Methodology

### Models
- **ResNet**: Standard residual network architecture
- **Wide ResNet (WRN)**: ResNet variant with increased width (more channels per layer)

### Approximation Methods
- Diagonal approximation (diag)
- Kernel approximation (kernel)
- Kronecker approximation (kron)

### Metrics
- **train_perf**: Training performance/accuracy
- **valid_perf**: Validation performance/accuracy
- **train_loss**: Training loss value
- **train_nll**: Training negative log-likelihood
- **valid_nll**: Validation negative log-likelihood
- **log_marglik**: Log marginal likelihood (Bayesian perspective)

### Experimental Design
For each combination of model architecture (ResNet, WRN) and approximation method (diag, kernel, kron), we track performance metrics over 100 epochs of training. This allows us to analyze both final performance and convergence behavior.

## Results
(This section will contain tables and plots generated from the analysis of the CSV files)

### Comparison of Final Performance
- Comparison of final validation performance across all models
- Analysis of generalization gap (difference between training and validation performance)
- Comparison of log marginal likelihood values

### Convergence Analysis
- Training and validation performance curves over epochs
- Convergence rates for different architectures and approximation methods

### Effect of Width on Approximation Methods
- Performance difference between ResNet and WRN for each approximation method
- Analysis of how width affects the quality of each approximation

## Discussion

### Width and the NTK Regime
We'll analyze how increasing network width affects the performance of different approximation methods, with particular attention to whether wider networks better align with theoretical predictions from the NTK regime.

### Optimization Landscape
By comparing convergence rates and final performance, we can infer properties of the optimization landscape for different network widths and approximation methods.

### Generalization Bounds
Analysis of the generalization gap will provide insights into how network width affects generalization capabilities and whether this aligns with theoretical generalization bounds.

## Conclusion & Future Work
Our research provides empirical evidence on the relationship between network width, approximation methods, and generalization in neural networks. We expect to find that wider networks show improved performance with certain approximation methods, potentially due to their closer alignment with the theoretical NTK regime.

Future work could investigate:
- The effect of depth versus width on approximation quality
- More sophisticated approximation methods for Fisher information matrices
- The impact of width on robustness to hyperparameter choices
- Theoretical connections between network width and Bayesian interpretations (as suggested by log marginal likelihood results)
